This is the Web Application for "La Esperanza" Golf Club. It allows the players of the club to login to their users, start a new game with their partners in it, use a score card that will automatically calculate the different types of scores in accordance to the new [USGA Rules of Handicapping](https://www.usga.org/handicapping/roh/2020-rules-of-handicapping.html) , submit their scores, update players handicaps, have statistics tracking for all the players of the club, and also allow them to see previous game history. 

## Build

**FrontEnd:**  HTML/CSS | JavaScript | React | Figma | Styled Components

**BackEnd:** Node | Express | Knex | REST API | SQLite 3

Planned, designed and coded the app entirely by myself from the ground up, front and back end. 

The logo is an actual photograph of the club's house which I took and then styled for a classic look with figma, the photograph of the landing of the app was taken by [@declan](https://twitter.com/dobledosis).  
  
The BackEnd is hosted on Heroku and you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/josegocampo/hcEsperanzino).
